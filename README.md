<h3 align="center">You know, I'm something of a blockchain developer myself</h3>

I've always been interested in the tech world, which led me to discover bitcoin
in 2016. My curiosity drove me to delve into blockchain development and
macroeconomics.

<h3>üßë‚Äçüíª About me:</h3>

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Next.js, SDK Moralis, Rust, and Substrate 
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on decentralized projects. 
- üì´ How to reach me: dreyess@uni.pe
- üîÆ As I look to the future, I am committed to continuing my professional growth and development, with a particular focus on blockchain and web3. 


<h3>üíº Portfolio:</h3>
- [NFT Marketplace](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/FrondEnd-Web3): NFTPunks, NFTPunks is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum that allows users to buy, sell and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The front-end is built using React.js and Web3.js, while the back-end utilizes Solidity smart contracts.

- [RafflePay](https://github.com/CevidevsHackaton/EthGlobalHackaton1): is a dApp that allows users to participate in raffles using Ethereum. The application is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses Solidity smart contracts for implementing the lottery system.

- [Automatic Withdrawal](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/ListenerWithdrawal_ETH_ERC20): is a set of scripts that automate the withdrawal process of funds from a wallet. The scripts are written in Python and make use of the Web3.py library to interact with the Ethereum network.

- [Unlock Protocol Integration](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/BluePiece-UnlockProtocol): BluePiece is a web application that integrates the Unlock Protocol to provide access to premium content to paying subscribers. The application is built using React.js and the Unlock Protocol smart contracts.

- [Upgradable Contracts](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/ContratosActualizados_Openzeppelin): Contratos Actualizables is a set of scripts that allow for the deployment of upgradable smart contracts. The scripts make use of the OpenZeppelin library to implement the upgradeable contract pattern.

- [Automated Swaps](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/Swap_Automatico_EVM): is a Solidity smart contract that allows for automated swaps between BNB and BUSD on the BSC network. The contract makes use of Pancakeswap for the token exchange.

- [Web_Todo](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/Web_Todo): is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage to-do lists. The application is built using React.js and styled with CSS.

- [ERC20 Airdrop](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/AirdropERC20): is a Solidity smart contract that allows for the airdrop of ERC20 tokens to a set of addresses. 

- [Solidity Practice](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/Solidity_Test): is a collection of Solidity smart contracts that implement different functionality, such as using OpenZeppelin libraries, Chainlink integration, and solidity methods.

- [Metamask Integration](https://github.com/phoenixdhr/MetamaskConnect2): is a simple web application that uses vanilla JavaScript to connect to the Ethereum network through Metamask and perform various operations, such as retrieving account balances and sending transactions, etc.
